# Feature Specification: Document planned facets and reconcile dual StateStore

**Branch**: `029-document-planned-facets-reconcile` | **Date**: 2026-02-08 | **Status**: Draft

## Summary

## Summary

Two cleanup items in the latency core package:

### 1. Unused Facet Interfaces

Five facet interfaces are defined and exported but never imported anywhere:
- `EventBus` (facets/events.ts)
- `SecretStore` (facets/secrets.ts)
- `StateStore` (facets/state.ts)
- `DecisionHandler` (facets/decision.ts)
- `WorkflowEngine` (facets/workflow.ts)

These appear to be forward-looking design. They should either be:
- Documented as planned/future (e.g., move to a `planned/` directory or add JSDoc `@planned` tags)
- Removed if no longer part of the roadmap

### 2. Dual StateStore Definitions

Two `StateStore` interfaces exist with different signatures:
- **facets/state.ts**: Async, generic type parameters — `get<T>(key): Promise<T | undefined>`
- **composition/context.ts**: Synchronous — `get(key): unknown`

This should be reconciled to avoid confusion.

## Tasks

1. Decide which unused facets are still planned and which should be removed
2. Add documentation (JSDoc or README) clarifying facet stability/maturity
3. Reconcile the dual `StateStore` — rename one or consolidate
4. Remove `LogLevel` type from facets/logging.ts if unused
