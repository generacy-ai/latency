# Tasks: Document planned facets and reconcile dual StateStore

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/029-document-planned-facets-reconcile/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md
**Status**: Complete

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to

## Phase 1: Document Planned Facets

- [ ] T001 [P] [US1] Add JSDoc `@remarks` to `EventBus` interface in `src/facets/events.ts`
- [ ] T002 [P] [US1] Add JSDoc `@remarks` to `SecretStore` interface in `src/facets/secrets.ts`
- [ ] T003 [P] [US1] Add JSDoc `@remarks` to `StateStore` interface in `src/facets/state.ts`
- [ ] T004 [P] [US1] Add JSDoc `@remarks` to `DecisionHandler` interface in `src/facets/decision.ts`
- [ ] T005 [P] [US1] Add JSDoc `@remarks` to `WorkflowEngine` interface in `src/facets/workflow.ts`
- [ ] T006 [US1] Create `src/facets/README.md` with facet maturity matrix

## Phase 2: Rename Sync StateStore

- [ ] T007 [US2] Rename `StateStore` → `PluginStateStore` in `src/composition/context.ts`
- [ ] T008 [US2] Update export in `src/composition/index.ts` to `PluginStateStore`
- [ ] T009 [US2] Update re-export in `src/index.ts` to `PluginStateStore`

## Phase 3: Verification

- [ ] T010 Verify build passes with `pnpm build`
- [ ] T011 Verify no duplicate StateStore definitions with grep

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Parallel Opportunities
- **T001-T005**: All JSDoc additions can run in parallel (independent files)
- **T006**: Can run in parallel with T001-T005, but logically complete after for reference consistency

### Sequential Dependencies
- **Phase 2 (T007-T009)**: Must be executed in order:
  1. T007: Rename interface in source file
  2. T008: Update composition barrel export
  3. T009: Update main barrel export
- **Phase 3 (T010-T011)**: Must run after Phases 1 and 2 complete

### Execution Summary
```
Phase 1: T001 ─┬─ T002 ─┬─ T003 ─┬─ T004 ─┬─ T005 ─┬─ T006
               └────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴───────┘ (all parallel)
                                    │
                                    ▼
Phase 2: T007 → T008 → T009 (sequential)
                    │
                    ▼
Phase 3: T010 → T011 (sequential verification)
```
