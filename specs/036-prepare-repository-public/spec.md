**Branch**: `036-prepare-repository-public` | **Date**: 2026-02-25 | **Status**: Draft

## Summary

## Prepare repository for public visibility

Add the required code artifacts and perform pre-publication audits before making the latency repo public.

### Tasks

1. **Add LICENSE file**
   - Choose appropriate open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)
   - Add LICENSE file to repo root

2. **Add SECURITY.md**
   - Define security policy and vulnerability reporting process
   - Add contact information for responsible disclosure

3. **Add .github/CODEOWNERS**
   - Define code ownership for automated PR review assignment
   - Map package directories to responsible team members

4. **Audit git history for secrets**
   - Scan full git history for accidentally committed secrets, credentials, API keys, .env files
   - Use tools like `git filter-repo` or BFG Repo Cleaner to scrub any findings
   - Verify no sensitive data remains in any commit

### Context

GitHub Settings configuration (branch protection, PR restrictions, interaction limits, Actions permissions) will be handled in a separate interactive session — not part of this issue.

### Acceptance criteria

- LICENSE file present in repo root
- SECURITY.md present in repo root
- .github/CODEOWNERS present and correctly configured
- Git history audited and clean of secrets
