## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please report it responsibly. **Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### Preferred: GitHub Security Advisories

Use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button on the [Security tab](../../security/advisories) of this repository. This creates a private advisory that is only visible to repository maintainers.

### Fallback: Email

If you are unable to use GitHub Security Advisories, you may email **security@generacy.ai** with details of the vulnerability. Please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if available)

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within **5 business days**.
- **Fix timeline**: We will work on a fix on a best-effort basis. Due to the early stage of this project, we do not commit to a fixed remediation timeline, but we take all reports seriously and prioritize them appropriately.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **coordinated disclosure** process:

1. Report the vulnerability privately using one of the channels above.
2. We will work with you to understand and validate the issue.
3. We will develop and test a fix.
4. We will release the fix and publish a security advisory.

We ask that reporters allow a reasonable amount of time for us to address the vulnerability before making any information public. We will coordinate with you on disclosure timing.
